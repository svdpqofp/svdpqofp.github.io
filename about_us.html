            <h2>History:</h2> <br>
            <p>The Beginnings of The Society of St. Vincent de Paul</p> <br>
            "The Society of St. Vincent de Paul originated in France during the midst of early 19th century
            turmoil. As a young student at the Sorbonne, Antoine Frédéric Ozanam was
            appalled by the conditions he saw in Paris. At a student meeting, another student challenged Ozanam and
            other practicing Catholics, admitting that while the Catholic Church had done much good work in the past, he
            could not see what good the Church was doing currently.

            On April 23, 1833, his 20th birthday, Ozanam invited five other students to a meeting, where they founded
            the first Conference of Charity to assist the poor. This Catholic lay organization was intended to help
            members increase in holiness by loving service to those in need. Shortly thereafter, they
            changed their name to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in honor of their patron saint."
